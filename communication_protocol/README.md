# ReadMe\_en

**(1)** This manual is dedicated for developers who develop the applications base on the xArm Modbus-TCP communication protocol. For xArm Studio application development, please refer to "xArm User Manual". For Python (C++ or ROS) application development, please refer to "1.6 Further Developer Resources".

**(2)** Considering the potential risks of using xArm Modbus-TCP communication protocol for application development, operators need to read and understand all the contents of "xArm User Manual", familiar with xArm risk assessment and robot motion planning, and proficient in robot parameter setting and program creating in "xArm Studio" before Modbus-TCP end developing.

Before meeting the above conditions, we strongly recommend operators should refer to 'xArm User Manual' and program xArm robot by xArm Studio. Until then, operators could start xArm Modbus-TCP application development based on the communication protocol xArm provided.

It will reduce the potential risks as well as increase the efficiency of your application development based on xArm Modbus-TCP.
